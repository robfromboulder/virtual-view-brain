# Virtual View: Session Closeout Instructions

> V3, 2026-09-23.

---

Governs session log entries in every canonical log and in each work item's `working/<LOBESPACE>_<WORK>_LOG.md` (once the brain has work-item machinery) — the entry format and content rules are the same regardless of destination. `<LOBESPACE>` throughout is the owning lobe's lobespace and `working/` that lobe's own directory — in a brain with one lobe, both are the brain's. **This format is the authority; do not imitate the previous entry** — a fresh file has none, and copying a neighbor lets the structure drift one merge at a time. Match sibling entries only where this spec is silent.

**Purpose.** The log is the work's lineage, traceable to each coding session, and the home for what **cannot be deduced from the codebase alone**: key findings, decision points (and who made each call), what was tried and didn't work, and the course-corrections that kept the work on track. It's a log, not a design doc — don't restate scope or strategy; give the turn-by-turn account of each session start to finish and what was learned.

**Routing — which log file to append to.** A session that belongs to an open work item — its docs still in `working/`, even if its PR has already merged — appends to that item's `working/<LOBESPACE>_<WORK>_LOG.md`; all other sessions append to a canonical log. Resolve ownership by the first matching signal, in priority order:

1. **Explicit direction** — the user names a target log or work item.
2. **Session content** — the session's work belongs to an open work item: its PR, branch, code area, or `working/<LOBESPACE>_<WORK>_*` docs (e.g. addressing review feedback on the item's PR from a different branch, or refining the item's plan in a session run from this repo).
3. **Current branch** — the session runs from a project repo and its checked-out branch matches the branch declared in an open work item's `<LOBESPACE>_<WORK>_CLAUDE.md` runbook (exact name or glob). A session run from this repo has no branch signal; never take one from a sibling checkout's incidental branch.
4. **No match** — append to the canonical log of the nearest common ancestor of the lobes the session's work concerned — not every lobe it read: a session that worked inside one lobe logs there, and one whose work crossed lobes logs to the lobe above them, however far apart in the tree they sit. In a brain with one lobe, that is always `VV_LOG.md`.

When the content and branch signals point at different work items, or either signal is ambiguous, ask rather than guess. The session that runs a work item's closeout appends to the canonical log of the lobe that owns the item: the item's `working/<LOBESPACE>_<WORK>_LOG.md` is merged and retired in that same pass, so a fresh entry there would land in `archive/` unmerged.

**Reading** (never read these large files in full): `grep -n '^---$' <log-file> | tail -1` gives the last separator's line `L`; read from `offset` `L`.

**Appending:**
1. Determine the target log file using the routing rule above.
2. Add a `---` at the end of that file, then the entry below it. **Append only — never revise or correct prior sessions.**
3. Entry shape: an H1 with a short title and date (`# <title> (YYYY-MM-DD)`); a `` **Session ID**: `<uuid>` `` line; a one-paragraph lead (what the session set out to do and what landed); then `##` subsections for the turn-by-turn lineage, decisions, what didn't work, and lessons — chosen per session, not a fixed template.
4. Session ID = newest transcript filename minus `.jsonl`, taken from the current session's project dir under `~/.claude/projects/`. That dir is derived from the directory the session was launched in: implementation work runs from a project repo; mini-brain-only work runs from this repo. Pick the transcript for the session you're recording — e.g. `ls -t ~/.claude/projects/<this-session's-project-dir>/*.jsonl | head -1`. Ask if it can't be determined.

**Content rules:** trace the lineage turn-by-turn (don't summarize the destination); class/method names are fine but no line numbers, no cross-document section or finding numbers (`§N`, "finding #N"), and no other drift-prone specifics — reference decisions and findings by their substance, which stays readable as the docs are renumbered and re-homed; skip anything re-derivable from the codebase; don't restate work-item scope or implementation strategy.

**Name the people.** The entry must make clear whose session it was: the lead names the human author (with Claude as co-author), and decisions stay attributed to whoever made each call. Don't lean on the Session ID to carry this — it's an opaque UUID.
